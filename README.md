# Robot Man

This is just a basic discord bot written in Python using the Discord.py library, mainly to challenge my own abilities but it also has tictactoe and reddit so that's cool 

## Help

Prefix is `>`, help command is `>help`, this defaults to a full list of command syntax for the bot, so don't worry about anything else
